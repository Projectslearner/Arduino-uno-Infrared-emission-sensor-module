# Arduino-uno-Infrared-emission-sensor-module
The Arduino Uno Infrared Emission Sensor Module emits infrared (IR) light and detects its reflection to measure distances or detect objects. It typically includes an IR LED and a photodiode, enabling applications such as proximity sensing, object detection, and line following in robotics and automation projects.
